1
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,433
Hey, you got me up for this.

2
00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:16,201
Yeah, sorry.

3
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:23,708
Eh, worrying ain't gonna
get 'em back any faster.

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,443
We should go after them, man.

5
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:27,578
They'll be back
when they get back.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,581
Now, just clear your mind.

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,083
All right.

8
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,258
They should be back.

9
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:45,563
They will be.

10
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:54,604
Hey, Troy promised
to keep Madison safe.

11
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,175
He promised me.
That means something to him.

12
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:01,445
Does it?

13
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:02,679
Yeah.

14
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:08,518
I protected him
when we were little.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,986
You can trust him.

16
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,055
On this, at least.

17
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:14,591
I'm more worried about the
people who shot us down.

18
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,321
- Jesus, Mom.
- Mike!

19
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,960
<i>- On the road.
- Come on.</i>

20
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,509
<i>You all right?</i>

21
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,513
What the hell happened?

22
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,681
We should talk private.

23
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,418
Talk private?
Did I hear you right?

24
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,888
Coop, Mike, inside.
Let's debrief.

25
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,589
Like hell, Jeremiah.

26
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,825
We all got a right
to hear what went down.

27
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,260
- You're out of line, Vern.
- We got a right to know what happened.

28
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,396
We need to know
how to defend ourselves.

29
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,031
- We gotta know...
- They were Indians.

30
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,370
- They slaughtered them.
- All right, all right.

31
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,604
They slaughtered all of them.

32
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,907
We made it home, huh?

33
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,076
It's nothing we can't handle.

34
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,777
They're dead. They're all dead.

35
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,579
Mike, lock your shit down.

36
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,080
Lock it down.

37
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,917
They're dead.

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,552
And we're gonna die, too,
if we don't leave!

39
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:53,219
- Shut up.
<i>- Is that true?</i>

40
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,622
- If we stay, we...
- Mike, shut the hell up.

41
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,290
If we stay, we die!

42
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:09,616

43
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:22,151
<i>No, no, no, we go after them.</i>

44
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:23,786
Now. We hit them back.

45
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:27,489
So you can stroll into another
ambush, Colonel Custer?

46
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,456
There was no way to know.

47
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,458
- No?
- No.

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,560
- Did you scout the campsite first?
- Dad.

49
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,496
Huh? Hike the perimeter?

50
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,932
<i>Or did you suffer
some distraction?</i>

51
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,268
Were your already
tasting the blood?

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,936
It wasn't Troy's fault.

53
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:43,738
Oh, you an expert?

54
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,107
No, we... we were cautious.

55
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,277
Ah. Well, let's extend
the caution now.

56
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,613
We're not attacking.

57
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,115
We're right to hold off,

58
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,418
<i>but Walker's not going away.</i>

59
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,985
He's weak.

60
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,822
That chickenshit atrocity
he pulled with Phil...

61
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,290
If he's weak, he'll negotiate.

62
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,092
Negotiate?
There's nothing to negotiate.

63
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,928
It's our land or their land.

64
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,495
<i>I mean, we either
stole it or we didn't.</i>

65
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:09,497
Stole?

66
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,733
Is this their land?

67
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:16,370
Every acre you tread is owned
and was owned before...

68
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,172
bought, leased,
or stolen in between.

69
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,007
And what about the ranch?

70
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,510
It was sold to my forebears.

71
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:25,346
And what the hell
does it matter now?

72
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,047
It matters if he doesn't stop.

73
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,384
It matters if your people think
they're on the wrong side.

74
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,586
Hey, this is my business
to manage.

75
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,856
Don't mistake yourself
or your place.

76
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,490
<i>Dad, she's trying to understand.</i>

77
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,692
Walker's a tribal lawyer.

78
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:41,228
Sued us since forever.

79
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,663
I handled it last couple years.

80
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,265
And we beat him every time.

81
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,334
And what if he comes back
to the door now?

82
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,835
He won't.

83
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:50,703
You've never seen
the Black Hat Reservation.

84
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:54,173
- Mm-mm.
- It's a truck stop, motel, and market.

85
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:57,042
Rocks and asphalt,
liquor and oxy,

86
00:04:57,044 --> 00:05:01,381
<i>drunken, diabetic
welfare cheats.</i>

87
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,549
I feel your liberal judgment.

88
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,050
It's palpable.

89
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,552
- <i>But that's not racism.</i>
- Isn't it?

90
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,256
No. It's truth.

91
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:13,425
And I'm talking about
<i>before</i> the apocalypse.

92
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:15,394
Doubt it's improved much since.

93
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,029
You say what you want,

94
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:20,732
but the man I saw
yesterday was a threat.

95
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,368
He had command.

96
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,571
Yeah? You got a little crush?

97
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,507
We gotta tell people something.

98
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,074
You talk to them.

99
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:33,077
It's good they start hearing
more from you anyway, Jake.

100
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:36,615
What do you want me to say?

101
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:41,519
Just say we got weapons
and walls and wherewithal.

102
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:45,390
Say all civilizations
are born of violence.

103
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,558
People give me a headache.

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Troy should come with me.

105
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:52,030
He was there, Da...

106
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,369
- Got it?
- Okay. I got it, I got it.

107
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:01,772
I've got it. Okay.

108
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,950
- Here, take this off.
- Oh, God.

109
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,451
Thank you.

110
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,499
- Here.
- Careful.

111
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,772
<i>Oh, Mom...</i>

112
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:39,509
Oh, God.

113
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,610
Damn.

114
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,257
She went south.
She knew people in Mexicali.

115
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,096
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:00,098 --> 00:07:01,263
She's strong.

117
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:10,606
So are you.

118
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:24,819
Hey!

119
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:27,655
Hey.

120
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:33,128
Sorry...

121
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,629
about the people you lost.

122
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:37,698
I didn't know most of them.

123
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,002
Phil McCarthy was here
since the beginning, but...

124
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,503
he wasn't a good man.

125
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,238
Your mom okay?

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,340
Will be.

127
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:47,875
Your dad?

128
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:50,878
No. Not really, no.

129
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,313
He's one of the last ones
standing.

130
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,182
And he's feeling that.

131
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,852
Russell lost in the fire,
McCarthy dead now.

132
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,856
Vernon's the only other
Founding Father left.

133
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,691
Just getting picked off
one by one.

134
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:08,161
Are you afraid?

135
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,597
No.

136
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,933
Border's a violent place,
always has been.

137
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,470
Show me?

138
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,483
Safety.

139
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:32,351
Semi-auto, like a pistol.

140
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:35,054
Full auto. Stick with semi.

141
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,661
Don't I need a new target?

142
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,863
Mine'll be the ones
in the bulls-eye.

143
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:52,071
What happens when your dad goes?

144
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,572
Who takes over the ranch?

145
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,074
Most people here
are libertarians.

146
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,742
They don't take orders
very well.

147
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,977
Tuck the stock
into your shoulder.

148
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:00,512
Don't tense.

149
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,114
Yeah, but people
look up to your dad.

150
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,648
Yeah, it was his land.

151
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,118
It'll pass to me and Troy
when he dies,

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,688
but people look to whoever
they feel is worth looking to.

153
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,824
Could be anybody. Could be you.

154
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,227
Your father wants it to be you.

155
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,665
Why wouldn't it be?

156
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,566
You're right, people are
gonna look to somebody.

157
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:26,604
And if it's not you...

158
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,918
Breathe out when you
squeeze the trigger.

159
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,797
Come in.

160
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,599
Sorry, Madison, sorry.

161
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,535
I was just looking for Alicia.

162
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,503
She's out and about, Gretchen.

163
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03,706
Probably with Jake.
I'll... I'll just...

164
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,041
Is Mike okay?

165
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,344
Freaked.

166
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,613
He said you saved him, though.

167
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:13,183
He said everybody
would have died without you.

168
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:15,285
Come in.

169
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,058
It isn't just my brother.

170
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,993
It's my whole family, my father.

171
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:26,328
Vernon? Sit down.

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,967
My dad doesn't think we're safe.

173
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:36,038
He helped make this place,
and<i> he</i> doesn't think it's safe.

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,873
I've never seen him scared,
not even when the dead rose.

175
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,809
- But he is.
- What'd he say?

176
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:43,011
He said he should have known,
that it would never end,

177
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:45,347
- that violence begets violence.
- Wait, wait, slow down, slow down.

178
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:47,849
He said it's just starting.

179
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:49,884
He wants to go.

180
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,820
He wants to leave the ranch.
I'm scared.

181
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:54,255
Shh, listen to me.

182
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:56,390
There's no place safer
than here.

183
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,860
Well, he doesn't believe that.

184
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,262
He knows a colony in Colorado.

185
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:06,067
Dad says the Rockies will
be safe, at elevation.

186
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,036
Who did he say that to?

187
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:10,238
Anyone who will listen.

188
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,873
He feels responsible.

189
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,942
He's a founder.

190
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,132
<i>Fire!</i>

191
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,636
<i>Fire! We got fire!</i>

192
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,174
<i>What's happening?</i>

193
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,144
<i>Everybody out!</i>

194
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,646
<i>No, they're everywhere!</i>

195
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,948
<i>They're all over the place!</i>

196
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,855
Son of a bitch.

197
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,315
50 yards from the front gate.

198
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,917
What the hell
was that sentry doing?

199
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,052
How many total?

200
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,087
Militia counts about 20.

201
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,022
All built to die like this one.

202
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,757
It's not meant to burn us out.

203
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,225
They want the land in one piece.

204
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,027
They want us off of it,
like they said.

205
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,830
They don't have the arms
or the balls,

206
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,998
so they do this bullshit.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,535
If Walker was gonna come,
he would have.

208
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:18,936
<i>But he can't.</i>

209
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,375
Your people are scared,
Jeremiah.

210
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:48,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

211
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,868
What brings you down here?

212
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,204
Uh, lumber?

213
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:56,406
Drywall screws.

214
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,542
You flying solo?

215
00:13:58,544 --> 00:14:02,812
- What?
- Luciana, she, uh... she take off?

216
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,248
Do me a favor.

217
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,217
Say her name again.

218
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:11,087
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, partner.

219
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,889
It's just good you didn't
take off after her.

220
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:14,824
That's all I'm saying.

221
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,425
Okay?

222
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:18,761
Whoa, Dax, Dax,
what are you doing?

223
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:20,929
- <i>Huh?</i>
- Don't start, Troy.

224
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,299
No, this is not a good time
to cut bait, Mrs. Daley.

225
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,134
Feels like the best time.

226
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:28,070
I have sacrificed too much.

227
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:31,307
Not gonna wait for them
to finish off my entire family.

228
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,676
They will pay. They will
pay for what they did.

229
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:37,913
Now, Dax... put the flour back.

230
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:41,016
I'm sorry Troy.
We've just been thinking...

231
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,751
Thinking? Thinking?

232
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:45,487
Thinking about stealing
our shit and hauling ass?

233
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:46,789
Huh?

234
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:52,193
This is what we put in.
Following the rules here.

235
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:56,164
Oh, the rules. Right, the rules.

236
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,800
Well, the rules are here for
the members of our community.

237
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:00,268
You leave, you're not a member.

238
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,136
Take it up with your father.

239
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,306
<i>We spoke this morning.</i>

240
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,978
All right.

241
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,213
Okay.

242
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:23,991
We should talk.

243
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:26,827
Um, should we?

244
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,362
I may disappoint.

245
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:31,298
- Listen, Vernon is...
- Wha...

246
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,233
Headaches still?

247
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,136
Migraines. You get 'em?

248
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:37,504
Unh-unh. Father did.

249
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,172
The light would start
to hurt him.

250
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:40,474
- Oh.
- Jeremiah...

251
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,375
What did you wanna say
about Vernon?

252
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:44,177
- He's...
- Right here.

253
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:48,715
- Jeremiah, can I get a word?
- Hmm?

254
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,250
Yeah. You're having one.

255
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:52,152
Uh, in private.

256
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:55,588
There's nothing you can't say in
front of Madison or anybody else.

257
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,794
Look, we're friends
going on 30 years.

258
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,262
You know I love this place.

259
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,431
I love what we started.

260
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:09,001
But a man's family comes first.

261
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:10,603
Just gotta protect them
best he knows how,

262
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,673
and the best I know how
is to leave.

263
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:16,008
Now.

264
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,210
A little precipitous,
don't you think?

265
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,545
Run off at the first sign
of trouble?

266
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,415
Sign of trouble?
They killed eight of ours.

267
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,951
They sawed Phil's...

268
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:27,786
Hell, Otto, that could've been...

269
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,855
All right, all right.

270
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:31,222
All right?

271
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,024
Well, what do you
want me to say?

272
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,726
You don't need my permission.

273
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,728
You wanna go, go.

274
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,565
You don't wanna go
out there, Mr. Trimbol.

275
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,801
My mind's made up.

276
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,538
I'm sorry, Jeremiah.

277
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,873
Mike going with you?

278
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,710
My family's leaving, Troy.

279
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,551
30 years, huh?

280
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,388
He wasn't always like that.

281
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,757
Some men, they have kids,
turns them into women.

282
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,428
He's a founder.

283
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,595
If you can't keep him here,

284
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,130
how you gonna keep
the rest of them?

285
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,633
Well, what would
you have me do, hmm?

286
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,468
Give them a reason
to stay, fight.

287
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,403
Give them a reason?

288
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,139
Aside from the fences
and the militia

289
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,641
and the stores
and this community, huh?

290
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,210
I welcome them onto my land
with open arms,

291
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,279
and now I gotta get down
on my hands and knees

292
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,780
and beg 'em to stay?

293
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,115
There's a fight coming.

294
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,418
Everyone who leaves
leaves us weaker.

295
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,787
To hell with this.

296
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:39,422
Troy!

297
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,131
Keep that gate closed, Jimmy!

298
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,167
- Your father gave the okay.
- I don't give a damn.

299
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,009
You open that gate
and I shoot you in the head.

300
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,139
Open the door.

301
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,708
- I'm not doing this, Troy.
- Open the door, Vernon.

302
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:05,314
Mike? Mike, get your
ass out here now.

303
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,350
<i>Come on, get your ass out here.</i>

304
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,018
People died for us, Mike!

305
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,187
Our people,
and you're gonna run, huh?!

306
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,890
- It's not what a man does, Mike!
- Troy. Troy!

307
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:17,325
Troy, stand down.
Dad said they could leave.

308
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,561
Yeah, he said they could leave,
not with ranch property.

309
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:21,329
What property? This is theirs.

310
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,533
They gassed up, didn't they?
Gas is ranch property.

311
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:27,735
And I guarantee you
that they took plenty of shit

312
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,037
from the pantry!

313
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,838
And I want to see
an inventory, Vernon!

314
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,341
- I want it inspected!
- This is not what Dad wants.

315
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,876
Why should I give a damn
what Dad wants?

316
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:36,311
He never gives a shit about me...

317
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,747
You're not protecting the ranch.

318
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,083
The hell do you know about it?

319
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:43,718
You haven't a clue
what this ranch is about.

320
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,686
I mean, she's been here
a week, and she gets it.

321
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:51,325
You gonna fight for what's yours
or you gonna surrender it, huh?

322
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,528
- That's not your call, is it?
- You gonna fight or you gonna surrender?

323
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,362
You're not in charge, are you?

324
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,166
What the hell
is wrong with you, huh?

325
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,368
- No! Hey, Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad.
<i>- No, no! Come on.</i>

326
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,869
<i>Come on.</i>

327
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,241
God damn it.

328
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:55,083
<i>Looking for something
to take out the old man?</i>

329
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:56,717
I've been there.

330
00:19:58,388 --> 00:19:59,887
It's the first thing
folks will grab

331
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,722
if there's a run on the place.

332
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,191
Good.

333
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,560
I was worried you might
do something rash.

334
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:08,263
To my family?

335
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:11,299
No, no. Never.

336
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,334
Can't blame my worry.

337
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:15,436
No.

338
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:18,238
All I've ever had
in my... my whole life

339
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,375
is this... this place and...

340
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:22,877
these people, and...

341
00:20:25,715 --> 00:20:27,582
I don't know, it just...

342
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:30,584
I don't understand, you know.

343
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:33,820
Like, the world out there,

344
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:36,357
it's, uh...

345
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,858
It's burned.

346
00:20:40,096 --> 00:20:43,297
They wanted to see
for themselves.

347
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,765
Anyone who leaves is dead to me.

348
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,937
Now, Mike, he was...

349
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:55,108
He was soft, but he was...

350
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,243
He's been my friend
since I was a kid.

351
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,082
He stayed in school
when I got... I got pulled.

352
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,284
But he never quit on me. Never.

353
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:08,621
Even when others did.

354
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:11,090
He didn't quit on you, Troy.

355
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,494
He just stood by his family.

356
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:19,164
He wouldn't look at me.

357
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:23,002
He just...

358
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:31,810
Hard to know how to
react to something like that.

359
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:34,179
You make sure
no one else leaves.

360
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,350
<i>Save them from the same mistake.</i>

361
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:40,985
I'll help you.

362
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,133
I want you all at attention.

363
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:07,211
All right. That's a start.

364
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:08,712
Tracking Mike down and beating
his ass into the ground,

365
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:10,114
that'd be a start.

366
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:13,817
No, Mike's gone.
He's not coming back.

367
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,852
That's the end of it.

368
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:18,822
I don't want to hear
his name again.

369
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:22,826
From now on, we set an example.

370
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:25,295
We become a model
of what this place needs...

371
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:29,032
Order, discipline,

372
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,702
chain of command.

373
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:35,906
We have to make those
people up there feel safe.

374
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:40,811
Or they'll leave, all of them.

375
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:45,014
We have to defend
this ranch with our lives

376
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:46,682
or they will be slaughtered,

377
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,751
all of them.

378
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:52,054
This place, this place
is all we have.

379
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:59,028
And right now,
it is... teetering.

380
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,731
And the only thing
that can save it is us.

381
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:05,001
Now, I'm not gonna draw
a line on the floor.

382
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:08,203
I'm not asking
whether you're with me.

383
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:10,572
You are with me, all of you.

384
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:15,277
Do you understand?

385
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,179
Yes, sir!

386
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:41,870
Jeremiah, what are you doing?

387
00:23:41,872 --> 00:23:44,039
This is where it goes,
right here.

388
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,578
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

389
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,714
I've been drinking here
all night, alone.

390
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:56,984
Here.

391
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:59,787
No, thanks.

392
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:03,324
Come on. You?

393
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,659
Especially me. I'm high on life.

394
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,832
I like that.

395
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,834
Hey, slow down.

396
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:15,936
- Slow down.
- Mm.

397
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:17,270
Ah.

398
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:19,106
What happened to your hand?

399
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,509
Oh... you know that song,

400
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,411
"Can't be with the one you love,

401
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,145
love the one you're with"?

402
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:30,783
Well, that goes the same...

403
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:32,819
with hitting people.

404
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,288
I don't mind.

405
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:41,127
The hand...

406
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,930
distracts from the headaches.

407
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:47,433
Well, listen, man,
tomorrow's another day,

408
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:48,868
a better day,
'cause you're gonna be

409
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,937
too hung over
to get in any fights.

410
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,872
So why don't
you just crash here?

411
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:01,614
This is a scared spot, you know.

412
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:05,183
<i>Me and Vern and Russell
and McCarthy,</i>

413
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,486
we sat here one night and...

414
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,690
conceived the movement.

415
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,028
My life's work.

416
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:25,170
Now two are dead and...

417
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:28,038
one is dead to me.

418
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:34,412
God damn it, man.

419
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,387
Jeremiah, no, no, no, hey!

420
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:07,043
I'm s... I'm sorry.

421
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,747
Your home. Your gun.

422
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,223
There's blood in it.

423
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,762
It's in the earth.

424
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:28,264
It's in the earth.

425
00:26:50,888 --> 00:26:52,554
<i>Bible study?</i>

426
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:00,729
Jake's.

427
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,133
Jake?

428
00:27:06,135 --> 00:27:07,602
It's nothing serious.

429
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,578
The rhythm method is bullshit.
I told you that, right?

430
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,145
Yes, when I was 13.

431
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,248
I thought you were
talking about a band.

432
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:29,357
There's birth control
in the pantry.

433
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,294
I'm sorry, it's just the
stakes are so much higher now.

434
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,937
You like him?

435
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:46,607
Like, yeah.

436
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,942
I'm not in love.

437
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:50,977
Been in love. This isn't it.

438
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:54,448
It can creep up on you.

439
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,783
Jake's important to us.

440
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,654
And I like him.

441
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:04,124
In that order?

442
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:07,994
Does there have to be an order?

443
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:20,039
Oh, God damn.

444
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,741
It's bright.

445
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,776
Good morning.

446
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:27,313
So, I raided the pantry.

447
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,648
Turns out "It's for
Otto" goes a long way.

448
00:28:32,486 --> 00:28:33,852
No, thanks.

449
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,658
About last night...

450
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,093
Last night I was
at the bunkhouse

451
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,195
with my mom and Alicia.

452
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:45,330
Why, did I miss anything?

453
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,013
How long has that been there?

454
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,924
Is it one of ours?

455
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,195
It's Vern's.

456
00:29:18,197 --> 00:29:20,531
- Go get your mother.
- <i>Why?</i>

457
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:22,566
Just go get your mother.

458
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:26,937
That's a baby.

459
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:49,523
They could have let it out.
It's a long way to go.

460
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:51,620
Two horses, a lot of feed,
lot of water.

461
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:52,990
They'd have slaughtered it.

462
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,594
They'd have killed it
if it were like that.

463
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:59,830
Treat the hide.

464
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,265
Cure the meat.

465
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,066
<i>They wouldn't just free it.</i>

466
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,568
So it escaped.

467
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,404
They're dead.

468
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,208
I know it.

469
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,777
It's just a question
of how they got that way.

470
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,247
Be ready for that.

471
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,762
"Black Hat Reservation"?

472
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,965
I'm going to Walker.
I'm gonna work this out.

473
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,867
I've known him for years.
I know Black Hat.

474
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,535
- You need a map to get there?
- No.

475
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm going off-grid. Back way.

476
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,608
It'll take longer,
but it's safer.

477
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,512
- Safer from Walker.
- Safer from my father in case

478
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:50,613
he sends Troy to stop me.

479
00:30:50,614 --> 00:30:52,048
He<i> should</i> stop you.

480
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,817
He killed your people.
He killed Travis.

481
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,151
He wasn't trying to kill Travis.

482
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,320
No, he was trying to kill<i> you.</i>

483
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:01,256
Yeah, good people die
easy as bad.

484
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,926
- What does that even mean?
- It's what I'm trying to stop.

485
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,727
More people will die.

486
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,496
You're right, I... I have to be

487
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,665
more than just a voice
in my father's ear.

488
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,834
I meant for you to step up
inside the camp, Jake,

489
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,569
not to go out
on some suicide mission.

490
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,137
I'm the only one
that can do this.

491
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,738
I've dealt with him.
I've settled with him.

492
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,508
- I've beaten him.
- When there were courts!

493
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,810
When there was rule of law!

494
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:25,113
Walker's not crazy.

495
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:27,148
He's just fighting
for his people who need him,

496
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,350
<i>people who always
got a raw deal.</i>

497
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:32,954
Jake, I'm asking you not to go.

498
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:17,196
Stay ready.

499
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:19,332
Lots of dead wander
around out here.

500
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,940
Vernon?

501
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:04,776
Kathy, too.

502
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:10,414
Mike.

503
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:10,473
<i>You gonna shoot?</i>

504
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,367
You all right?

505
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,302
She's Alicia's age.

506
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:42,837
Yeah.

507
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,843
He thinks it was Troy.

508
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,545
No, I don't think so.

509
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,715
Don't think so
or you don't want to?

510
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,117
Even for Troy, this is...

511
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,353
We know Walker was close.
I've seen what he's done.

512
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:01,990
Indians, right?

513
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:05,125
Took everything?
Took the helicopter?

514
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:07,094
- Even took your shoes?
- Yeah.

515
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:10,363
Would they leave this?

516
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:13,400
Horses? The RV?

517
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,735
There's a week's worth of
food and supplies in there.

518
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:29,381
All the things he's done...

519
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:32,151
never anything like this.

520
00:35:32,153 --> 00:35:34,520
Not to his own people.

521
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:36,155
Can't be absolutely sure.

522
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,859
I don't think of him as a man.

523
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:42,928
My boys, they go away
a couple days,

524
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,530
they come to mind.

525
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:47,233
It's like they're seven,
eight years old again.

526
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,038
I don't know what to do.

527
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:00,278
We have to go back.

528
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Now.

529
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:05,917
<i>Troy!</i>

530
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:58,067
<i>What happened to them?</i>

531
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:00,771
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:04,174
They were good people.
They didn't deserve this end.

533
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:08,144
Our family, we... we weren't
prepared like you.

534
00:37:08,146 --> 00:37:10,947
<i>We were strangers,
but you took us in.</i>

535
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:12,682
<i>We've come to love it here.</i>

536
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:17,687
I wish... my husband
had lived to see it.

537
00:37:18,924 --> 00:37:20,323
But he was killed.

538
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,159
Travis was killed.

539
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:28,931
He was killed by the same
people who killed Phil

540
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,700
and our people at the outpost.

541
00:37:38,642 --> 00:37:40,442
The same people...

542
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:43,478
Walker's people...

543
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:48,383
<i>have now killed our friends...</i>

544
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:51,820
<i>Vernon, Kathy, Mike...</i>

545
00:37:51,822 --> 00:37:54,323
- <i>Gretchen.</i>
- This is crazy, dude.

546
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:57,859
I've seen firsthand
how Walker treats his victims.

547
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,696
I saw it at the outpost,
and I just now saw it again.

548
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,466
<i>You built this place together.</i>

549
00:38:04,468 --> 00:38:06,868
<i>Because of that, you've
been safe and sheltered.</i>

550
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,870
<i>You haven't been out in the world.
We have.</i>

551
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:12,539
I'm telling you,
there's nothing out there.

552
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,976
If you leave, you'll die.

553
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:18,246
<i>Walker's people aren't strong
enough to force us off this land.</i>

554
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:19,646
<i>They're trying to scare us.</i>

555
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,048
<i>That's how they want us to go...</i>

556
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,817
A family or two at a time,

557
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:27,021
out there alone
where nobody can see,

558
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,690
where our militia
can't protect us.

559
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:32,559
<i>We cannot let ourselves
be fractured.</i>

560
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,094
There are more of us.

561
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:36,363
We're better armed.

562
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:39,733
If we stay here together,
we live.

563
00:38:42,438 --> 00:38:44,570
<i>Yes. Yeah.</i>

564
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:23,953
That was impressive as all hell.

565
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:26,188
It was necessary.

566
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:31,860
How do you tell a lie that
big and sleep at night?

567
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,463
How do you do that?

568
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,164
What I said was true.

569
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,801
None of these folks
will die, not tonight,

570
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:40,769
not tomorrow,
maybe not for a long time.

571
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:43,539
You and Alicia are safe.

572
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,507
I'll sleep like a baby.

573
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,111
Say it<i> was</i> Troy.

574
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,847
It was.

575
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,949
No one would believe us.

576
00:39:53,951 --> 00:39:57,018
They're more afraid of what's out
there than anything he could do.

577
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,720
You should've told me first
before you did this.

578
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:01,489
You would've said no.

579
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:03,425
No. I get it.

580
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:07,062
I hate it, I get it.

581
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:10,064
I would have backed you
like I'm backing you now.

582
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:15,470
Just don't forget what he is.

583
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,252
I didn't go out there
to do that, I swear.

584
00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:33,553
I...

585
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,724
He owed me.

586
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:43,930
He had to look me
directly in the eye.

587
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:47,400
He had to say it to my face, say it
like Vernon said it to my father.

588
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:52,171
He owed me that.

589
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:54,374
He didn't want
to do that, did he?

590
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:01,080
He said some things, and...

591
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:03,016
I did some things.

592
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,187
Then it went bad.

593
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:18,296
Not what you want
to hear, is it?

594
00:41:18,298 --> 00:41:20,532
You could run this place, Troy,

595
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:23,635
but not if you let things
break like that.

596
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:26,571
Last night you had command.
I saw that.

597
00:41:26,573 --> 00:41:30,909
Your militia saw that,
and they responded.

598
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,678
Your brother doesn't have
what you have.

599
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,080
He's not of this place.

600
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:39,983
You're the survivor.
You're the heir.

601
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:41,485
So, no, the last thing
I want to hear

602
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:42,986
is how you lost control.

603
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:44,821
That can't happen.

604
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:49,993
I don't care how you did it.

605
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,431
I don't care why you did it.

606
00:41:54,433 --> 00:41:57,801
All I care about
is that you can control it.

607
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:05,408
There's a fight coming,
and you have to save us.

608
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,777
Can you?

609
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,784
Yes, ma'am.

610
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:37,066
