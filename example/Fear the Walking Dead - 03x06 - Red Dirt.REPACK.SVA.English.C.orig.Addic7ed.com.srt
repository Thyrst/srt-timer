1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:03,265
<i>Previously on AMC's
"Fear the Walking Dead"...</i>

2
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:05,567
The land you've lived on
needs to be returned.

3
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:07,602
Abandon the ranch.

4
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:09,404
Being a leader is
knowing when to stop.

5
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,710
Troy and the militia
do what we can't.

6
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:17,179
They protect us.

7
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,415
You...can't rely
on the Troys of the world.

8
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:21,650
I can't live here.

9
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:23,818
I'm not gonna make you.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,887
This was my home.

11
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,022
Every homeowner needs a gun.

12
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,833
Hey, you got me up for this.

13
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:40,601
Yeah, sorry.

14
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:48,108
Eh, worrying ain't gonna
get 'em back any faster.

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,843
We should go after them, man.

16
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,978
They'll be back
when they get back.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,981
Now, just clear your mind.

18
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,483
All right.

19
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:05,458
They should be back.

20
00:01:08,663 --> 00:01:09,963
They will be.

21
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:19,004
Hey, Troy promised
to keep Madison safe.

22
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,575
He promised me.
That means something to him.

23
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:25,845
Does it?

24
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,079
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:32,918
I protected him
when we were little.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,386
You can trust him.

27
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:36,455
On this, at least.

28
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:38,991
I'm more worried about the
people who shot us down.

29
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,721
- Jesus, Mom.
- Mike!

30
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:16,360
<i>- On the road.
- Come on.</i>

31
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:31,909
<i>You all right?</i>

32
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:35,913
What the hell happened?

33
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,081
We should talk private.

34
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,818
Talk private?
Did I hear you right?

35
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,288
Coop, Mike, inside.
Let's debrief.

36
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,989
Like hell, Jeremiah.

37
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,225
We all got a right
to hear what went down.

38
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:50,660
- You're out of line, Vern.
- We got a right to know what happened.

39
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,796
We need to know
how to defend ourselves.

40
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,431
- We gotta know--
- They were Indians.

41
00:02:58,837 --> 00:03:00,770
- They slaughtered them.
- All right, all right.

42
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:02,004
They slaughtered all of them.

43
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,307
We made it home, huh?

44
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,476
It's nothing we can't handle.

45
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,177
They're dead.
They're all dead.

46
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,979
Mike, lock your shit down.

47
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,480
Lock it down.

48
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,317
They're dead.

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,952
And we're gonna die, too,
if we don't leave!

50
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,619
- Shut up.
<i>- Is that true?</i>

51
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:20,022
- If we stay, we--
- Troy: Mike, shut the hell up.

52
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:21,690
If we stay, we die!

53
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:36,128

54
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,851
<i>No, no, no, we go after them.</i>

55
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,486
Now.
We hit them back.

56
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:51,089
So you can stroll into another
ambush, Colonel Custer?

57
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,056
There was no way to know.

58
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,058
- No?
- No.

59
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,160
- Did you scout the campsite first?
- Dad.

60
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,096
Huh?
Hike the perimeter?

61
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,532
<i>Or did you suffer
some distraction?</i>

62
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,868
Were your already
tasting the blood?

63
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,536
It wasn't Troy's fault.

64
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:07,338
Oh, you an expert?

65
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,707
No, we--
we were cautious.

66
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,877
Ah. Well, let's extend
the caution now.

67
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,213
We're not attacking.

68
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:17,715
We're right to hold off,

69
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,018
<i>but Walker's not going away.</i>

70
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,585
He's weak.

71
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:24,422
That chickenshit atrocity
he pulled with Phil--

72
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:25,890
If he's weak, he'll negotiate.

73
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,692
Negotiate?
There's nothing to negotiate.

74
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,528
It's our land or their land.

75
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,095
<i>I mean, we either
stole it or we didn't.</i>

76
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,097
Stole?

77
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:36,333
Is this their land?

78
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,970
Every acre you tread is owned
and was owned before--

79
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:42,772
bought, leased,
or stolen in between.

80
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,607
And what about the ranch?

81
00:04:44,609 --> 00:04:47,110
It was sold to my forebears.

82
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,946
And what the hell
does it matter now?

83
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,647
It matters if he doesn't stop.

84
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:53,984
It matters if your people think
they're on the wrong side.

85
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,186
Hey, this is my business
to manage.

86
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:59,456
Don't mistake yourself
or your place.

87
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,090
<i>Dad, she's trying to understand.</i>

88
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,292
Walker's a tribal lawyer.

89
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,828
Sued us since forever.

90
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,263
I handled it last couple years.

91
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,865
And we beat him every time.

92
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,934
And what if he comes back
to the door now?

93
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,435
He won't.

94
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,303
You've never seen
the Black Hat Reservation.

95
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:17,773
- Mm-mm.
- It's a truck stop, motel, and market.

96
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,642
Rocks and asphalt,
liquor and oxy,

97
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:24,981
<i>drunken, diabetic
welfare cheats.</i>

98
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,149
I feel your liberal judgment.

99
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:28,650
It's palpable.

100
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:31,152
- <i>But that's not racism.</i>
- Isn't it?

101
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:33,856
No. It's truth.

102
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:37,025
And I'm talking about
<i>before</i> the apocalypse.

103
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,994
Doubt it's improved much since.

104
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,629
You say what you want,

105
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,332
but the man I saw
yesterday was a threat.

106
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:45,968
He had command.

107
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,171
Yeah?
You got a little crush?

108
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:52,107
We gotta tell people something.

109
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:53,674
You talk to them.

110
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,677
It's good they start hearing
more from you anyway, Jake.

111
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:00,215
What do you want me to say?

112
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:05,119
Just say we got weapons
and walls and wherewithal.

113
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,990
Say all civilizations
are born of violence.

114
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:11,158
People give me a headache.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,360
Troy should come with me.

116
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:15,630
He was there, Da--

117
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,969
- Got it?
- Okay. I got it, I got it.

118
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:25,372
I've got it.
Okay.

119
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,550
- Here, take this off.
- Oh, God.

120
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,051
Thank you.

121
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,099
- Here.
- Careful.

122
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,372
<i>Oh, Mom...</i>

123
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:03,109
Oh, God.

124
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,210
Damn.

125
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,857
She went south.
She knew people in Mexicali.

126
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,696
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:24,863
She's strong.

128
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,206
So are you.

129
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:48,419
Hey!

130
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,255
Hey.

131
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,728
Sorry...

132
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,229
about the people you lost.

133
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,298
I didn't know most of them.

134
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,602
Phil McCarthy was here
since the beginning, but...

135
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,103
he wasn't a good man.

136
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,838
Your mom okay?

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,940
Will be.

138
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:11,475
Your dad?

139
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:14,478
No.
Not really, no.

140
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,913
He's one of the last ones
standing.

141
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,782
And he's feeling that.

142
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:22,452
Russell lost in the fire,
McCarthy dead now.

143
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:26,456
Vernon's the only other
Founding Father left.

144
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,291
Just getting picked off
one by one.

145
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,761
Are you afraid?

146
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,197
No.

147
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,533
Border's a violent place,
always has been.

148
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:41,070
Show me?

149
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,083
Safety.

150
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:55,951
Semi-auto,
like a pistol.

151
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,654
Full auto. Stick with semi.

152
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,261
Don't I need a new target?

153
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,463
Mine'll be the ones
in the bulls-eye.

154
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,671
What happens when your dad goes?

155
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,172
Who takes over the ranch?

156
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:18,674
Most people here
are libertarians.

157
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:20,342
They don't take orders
very well.

158
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,577
Tuck the stock
into your shoulder.

159
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,112
Don't tense.

160
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,714
Yeah, but people
look up to your dad.

161
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,248
Yeah, it was his land.

162
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,718
It'll pass to me and Troy
when he dies,

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,288
but people look to whoever
they feel is worth looking to.

164
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,424
Could be anybody.
Could be you.

165
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,827
Your father wants it to be you.

166
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,265
Why wouldn't it be?

167
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,166
You're right, people are
gonna look to somebody.

168
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,204
And if it's not you...

169
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,518
Breathe out when you
squeeze the trigger.

170
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,397
Come in.

171
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,199
Sorry, Madison, sorry.

172
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,135
I was just looking for Alicia.

173
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,103
She's out and about, Gretchen.

174
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,306
Probably with Jake.
I'll-- I'll just--

175
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:28,641
Is Mike okay?

176
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,944
Freaked.

177
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,213
He said you saved him, though.

178
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,783
He said everybody
would have died without you.

179
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,885
Come in.

180
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,658
It isn't just my brother.

181
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,593
It's my whole family, my father.

182
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:49,928
Vernon?
Sit down.

183
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,567
My dad doesn't think we're safe.

184
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:59,638
He helped make this place,
and<i> he</i> doesn't think it's safe.

185
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,473
I've never seen him scared,
not even when the dead rose.

186
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,409
- But he is.
- What'd he say?

187
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:06,611
He said he should have known,
that it would never end,

188
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:08,947
- that violence begets violence.
- Wait, wait, slow down, slow down.

189
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,449
He said it's just starting.

190
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:13,484
He wants to go.

191
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,420
He wants to leave the ranch.
I'm scared.

192
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:17,855
Shh, listen to me.

193
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:19,990
There's no place safer
than here.

194
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,460
Well, he doesn't believe that.

195
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,862
He knows a colony in Colorado.

196
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:29,667
Dad says the Rockies will
be safe, at elevation.

197
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,636
Who did he say that to?

198
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,838
Anyone who will listen.

199
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,473
He feels responsible.

200
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,542
He's a founder.

201
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,732
<i>Fire!</i>

202
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,236
<i>Fire!
We got fire!</i>

203
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,774
<i>What's happening?</i>

204
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:49,744
<i>Everybody out!</i>

205
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,246
<i>No, they're everywhere!</i>

206
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:53,548
<i>They're all over the place!</i>

207
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,455
Son of a bitch.

208
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,315
50 yards from the front gate.

209
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:21,917
What the hell
was that sentry doing?

210
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,052
How many total?

211
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,087
Militia counts about 20.

212
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,022
All built to die like this one.

213
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:28,757
It's not meant to burn us out.

214
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,225
They want the land in one piece.

215
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,027
They want us off of it,
like they said.

216
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,830
They don't have the arms
or the balls,

217
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,998
so they do this bullshit.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,535
If Walker was gonna come,
he would have.

219
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,936
<i>But he can't.</i>

220
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,375
Your people are scared,
Jeremiah.

221
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:11,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

222
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,868
What brings you down here?

223
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,204
Uh, lumber?

224
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,406
Drywall screws.

225
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,542
You flying solo?

226
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:25,812
- What?
- Luciana, she, uh-- she take off?

227
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,248
Do me a favor.

228
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,217
Say her name again.

229
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:34,087
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy, partner.

230
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,889
It's just good you didn't
take off after her.

231
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,824
That's all I'm saying.

232
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,425
Okay?

233
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:41,761
Whoa, Dax, Dax,
what are you doing?

234
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,929
- <i>Huh?</i>
- Don't start, Troy.

235
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,299
No, this is not a good time
to cut bait, Mrs. Daley.

236
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,134
Feels like the best time.

237
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:51,070
I have sacrificed too much.

238
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:54,307
Not gonna wait for them
to finish off my entire family.

239
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:56,676
They will pay. They will
pay for whathey did.

240
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,913
Now, Dax...
put the flour back.

241
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:04,016
I'm sorry Troy.
We've just been thinking--

242
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,751
Thinking? Thinking?

243
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:08,487
Thinking about stealing
our shit and hauling ass?

244
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:09,789
Huh?

245
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:15,193
This is what we put in.
Following the rules here.

246
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:19,164
Oh, the rules.
Right, the rules.

247
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,800
Well, the rules are here for
the members of our community.

248
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:23,268
You leave, you're not a member.

249
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,136
Take it up with your father.

250
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:27,306
<i>We spoke this morning.</i>

251
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,978
All right.

252
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,213
Okay.

253
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:46,991
We should talk.

254
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,827
Um, should we?

255
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:51,362
I may disappoint.

256
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:54,298
- Listen, Vernon is--
- Wha--

257
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,233
Headaches still?

258
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:59,136
Migraines.
You get 'em?

259
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,504
Unh-unh.
Father did.

260
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,172
The light would start
to hurt him.

261
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:03,474
- Oh.
- Jeremiah--

262
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,375
What did you wanna say
about Vernon?

263
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,177
- He's--
- Right here.

264
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,715
- Jeremiah, can I get a word?
- Hmm?

265
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,250
Yeah.
You're having one.

266
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,152
Uh, in private.

267
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:18,588
There's nothing you can't say in
front of Madison or anybody else.

268
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,794
Look, we're friends
going on 30 years.

269
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,262
You know I love this place.

270
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:28,431
I love what we started.

271
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:32,001
But a man's family comes first.

272
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:33,603
Just gotta protect them
best he knows how,

273
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:36,673
and the best I know how
is to leave.

274
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:39,008
Now.

275
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,210
A little precipitous,
don't you think?

276
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:43,545
Run off at the first sign
of trouble?

277
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,415
Sign of trouble?
They killed eight of ours.

278
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,951
They sawed Phil's...

279
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:50,786
Hell, Otto,
that could've been--

280
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,855
All right, all right.

281
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,222
All right?

282
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,024
Well, what do you
want me to say?

283
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,726
You don't need my permission.

284
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,728
You wanna go, go.

285
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,565
You don't wanna go
out there, Mr. Trimbol.

286
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,801
My mind's made up.

287
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:10,538
I'm sorry, Jeremiah.

288
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,873
Mike going with you?

289
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,710
My family's leaving, Troy.

290
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,551
30 years, huh?

291
00:17:23,553 --> 00:17:26,388
He wasn't always like that.

292
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,757
Some men, they have kids,
turns them into women.

293
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,428
He's a founder.

294
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,595
If you can't keep him here,

295
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,130
how you gonna keep
the rest of them?

296
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:38,633
Well, what would
you have me do, hmm?

297
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:40,468
Give them a reason
to stay, fight.

298
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,403
Give them a reason?

299
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:45,139
Aside from the fences
and the militia

300
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,641
and the stores
and this community, huh?

301
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:50,210
I welcome them onto my land
with open arms,

302
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:52,279
and now I gotta get down
on my hands and knees

303
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,780
and beg 'em to stay?

304
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,115
There's a fight coming.

305
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,418
Everyone who leaves
leaves us weaker.

306
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,787
To hell with this.

307
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,422
Troy!

308
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:12,131
Keep that gate closed, Jimmy!

309
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,167
- Your father gave the okay.
- I don't give a damn.

310
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,009
You open that gate
and I shoot you in the head.

311
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,139
Open the door.

312
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,708
- I'm not doing this, Troy.
- Open the door, Vernon.

313
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:28,314
Mike? Mike, get your
ass out here now.

314
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,350
<i>Come on, get your ass out here.</i>

315
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,018
People died for us, Mike!

316
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,187
Our people,
and you're gonna run, huh?!

317
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:37,890
- It's not what a man does, Mike!
- Troy. Troy!

318
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:40,325
Troy, stand down.
Dad said they could leave.

319
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,561
Yeah, he said they could leave,
not with ranch property.

320
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,329
What property?
This is theirs.

321
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,533
They gassed up, didn't they?
Gas is ranch property.

322
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:50,735
And I guarantee you
that they took plenty of shit

323
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,037
from the pantry!

324
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,838
And I want to see
an inventory, Vernon!

325
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,341
- I want it inspected!
- This is not what Dad wants.

326
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,876
Why should I give a damn
what Dad wants?

327
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,311
He never gives a shit
about me--

328
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:02,747
You're not protecting the ranch.

329
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,083
The hell do you know about it?

330
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,718
You haven't a clue
what this ranch is about.

331
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,686
I mean, she's been here
a week, and she gets it.

332
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:14,325
You gonna fight for what's yours
or you gonna surrender it, huh?

333
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,528
- That's not your call, is it?
- You gonna fight or you gonna surrender?

334
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,362
You're not in charge, are you?

335
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,166
What the hell
is wrong with you, huh?

336
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:24,368
- No! Hey, Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad.
<i>- No, no! Come on.</i>

337
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,869
<i>Come on.</i>

338
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,241
God damn it.

339
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,483
<i>Looking for something
to take out the old man?</i>

340
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:19,117
I've been there.

341
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:22,287
It's the first thing
folks will grab

342
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,122
if there's a run on the place.

343
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,591
Good.

344
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,960
I was worried you might
do something rash.

345
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:30,663
To my family?

346
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,699
No, no.
Never.

347
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,734
Can't blame my worry.

348
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,836
No.

349
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,638
All I've ever had
in my-- my whole life

350
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,775
is this--
this place and...

351
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,277
these people, and...

352
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,982
I don't know, it just...

353
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,984
I don't understand, you know.

354
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,220
Like, the world out there,

355
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,757
it's, uh--

356
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,258
it's burned.

357
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,697
They wanted to see
for themselves.

358
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,165
Anyone who leaves is dead to me.

359
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,337
Now, Mike, he was--

360
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,508
he was soft,
but he was--

361
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,643
he's been my friend
since I was a kid.

362
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,482
He stayed in school
when I got-- I got pulled.

363
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,684
But he never quit on me.
Never.

364
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,021
Even when others did.

365
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,490
He didn't quit on you, Troy.

366
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,894
He just stood by his family.

367
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,564
He wouldn't look at me.

368
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,402
He just...

369
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:54,210
Hard to know how to
react to something like that.

370
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,579
You make sure
no one else leaves.

371
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,750
<i>Save them from the same mistake.</i>

372
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,385
I'll help you.

373
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,533
I want you all at attention.

374
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,611
All right.
That's a start.

375
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,112
Tracking Mike down and beating
his ass into the ground,

376
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,514
that'd be a start.

377
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:36,217
No, Mike's gone.
He's not coming back.

378
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:38,252
That's the end of it.

379
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:41,222
I don't want to hear
his name again.

380
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:45,226
From now on, we set an example.

381
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:47,695
We become a model
of what this place needs--

382
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:51,432
order, discipline,

383
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,102
chain of command.

384
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:58,306
We have to make those
people up there feel safe.

385
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:03,211
Or they'll leave, all of them.

386
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:07,414
We have to defend
this ranch with our lives

387
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,082
or they will be slaughtered,

388
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,151
all of them.

389
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:14,454
This place, this place
is all we have.

390
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:21,428
And right now,
it is... teetering.

391
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,131
And the only thing
that can save it is us.

392
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:27,401
Now, I'm not gonna draw
a line on the floor.

393
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:30,603
I'm not asking
whether you're with me.

394
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:32,972
You are with me, all of you.

395
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:37,677
Do you understand?

396
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,579
Yes, sir!

397
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:04,270
Jeremiah, what are you doing?

398
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:06,439
This is where it goes,
right here.

399
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,978
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

400
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,114
I've been drinking here
all night, alone.

401
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:19,384
Here.

402
00:24:19,386 --> 00:24:22,187
No, thanks.

403
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,724
Come on. You?

404
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:28,059
Especially me.
I'm high on life.

405
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:34,232
I like that.

406
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:36,234
Hey, slow down.

407
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:38,336
- Slow down.
- Mm.

408
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,670
Ah.

409
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:41,506
What happened to your hand?

410
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:44,909
Oh...
you know that song,

411
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:46,811
"Can't be with the one you love,

412
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,545
love the one you're with"?

413
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:53,183
Well, that goes the same...

414
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:55,219
with hitting people.

415
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:57,688
I don't mind.

416
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:03,527
The hand...

417
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:06,330
distracts from the headaches.

418
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:09,833
Well, listen, man,
tomorrow's another day,

419
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,268
a better day,
'cause you're gonna be

420
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,337
too hung over
to get in any fights.

421
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:15,272
So why don't
you just crash here?

422
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:24,014
This is a scared spot, you know.

423
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,583
<i>Me and Vern and Russell
and McCarthy,</i>

424
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,886
we sat here one night and...

425
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,090
conceived the movement.

426
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,428
My life's work.

427
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:47,570
Now two are dead and...

428
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,438
one is dead to me.

429
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,812
God damn it, man.

430
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,787
Jeremiah, no, no, no, hey!

431
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:29,443
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

432
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,147
Your home.
Your gun.

433
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,623
There's blood in it.

434
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:49,162
It's in the earth.

435
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:50,664
It's in the earth.

436
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,954
<i>Bible study?</i>

437
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,129
Jake's.

438
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,533
Jake?

439
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,002
It's nothing serious.

440
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,978
The rhythm method is bullshit.
I told you that, right?

441
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,545
Yes, when I was 13.

442
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:42,648
I thought you were
talking about a band.

443
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:51,757
There's birth control
in the pantry.

444
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,694
I'm sorry, it's just the
stakes are so much higher now.

445
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:06,337
You like him?

446
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:09,007
Like, yeah.

447
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,342
I'm not in love.

448
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:13,377
Been in love.
This isn't it.

449
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:16,848
It can creep up on you.

450
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,183
Jake's important to us.

451
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:24,054
And I like him.

452
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:26,524
In that order?

453
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:30,394
Does there have to be an order?

454
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:42,439
Oh, God damn.

455
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:44,141
It's bright.

456
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:46,176
Good morning.

457
00:28:46,178 --> 00:28:49,713
So, I raided the pantry.

458
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:52,048
Turns out "It's for
Otto" goes a long way.

459
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:56,252
No, thanks.

460
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,058
About last night...

461
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,493
Last night I was
at the bunkhouse

462
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:05,595
with my mom and Alicia.

463
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,730
Why, did I miss anything?

464
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,413
How long has that been there?

465
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:36,324
Is it one of ours?

466
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,595
It's Vern's.

467
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:42,931
- Go get your mother.
- <i>Why?</i>

468
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,966
Just go get your mother.

469
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:49,337
That's a baby.

470
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:10,923
They could have let it out.
It's a long way to go.

471
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,020
Two horses, a lot of feed,
lot of water.

472
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,390
They'd have slaughtered it.

473
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,994
They'd have killed it
if it were like that.

474
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,230
Treat the hide.

475
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:22,665
Cure the meat.

476
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,466
<i>They wouldn't just free it.</i>

477
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:25,968
So it escaped.

478
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,804
They're dead.

479
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,608
I know it.

480
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,177
It's just a question
of how they got that way.

481
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:38,647
Be ready for that.

482
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:54,162
"Black Hat Reservation"?

483
00:30:54,164 --> 00:30:57,365
I'm going to Walker.
I'm gonna work this out.

484
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,267
I've known him for years.
I know Black Hat.

485
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:00,935
- You need a map to get there?
- No.

486
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
I'm going off-grid.
Back way.

487
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:08,008
It'll take longer,
but it's safer.

488
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,012
- Safer from Walker.
- Safer from my father in case he sends Troy to stop me.

489
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:13,448
He<i> should</i> stop you.

490
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,217
He killed your people.
He killed Travis.

491
00:31:16,219 --> 00:31:17,551
He wasn't trying to kill Travis.

492
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:19,720
No, he was trying to kill<i> you.</i>

493
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:22,656
Yeah, good people die
easy as bad.

494
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:25,326
- What does that even mean?
- It's what I'm trying to stop.

495
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,127
More people will die.

496
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,896
You're right,
I-- I have to be

497
00:31:28,898 --> 00:31:31,065
more than just a voice
in my father's ear.

498
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:34,234
I meant for you to step up
inside the camp, Jake,

499
00:31:34,236 --> 00:31:35,969
not to go out
on some suicide mission.

500
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,537
I'm the only one
that can do this.

501
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:39,138
I've dealt with him.
I've settled with him.

502
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,908
- I've beaten him.
- When there were courts!

503
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,210
When there was rule of law!

504
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:46,513
Walker's not crazy.

505
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:48,548
He's just fighting
for his people who need him,

506
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,750
<i>people who always
got a raw deal.</i>

507
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:54,354
Jake, I'm asking you not to go.

508
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:38,596
Stay ready.

509
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,732
Lots of dead wander
around out here.

510
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,340
Vernon?

511
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,176
Kathy, too.

512
00:33:30,515 --> 00:33:31,814
Mike.

513
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:31,873
<i>You gonna shoot?</i>

514
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,767
You all right?

515
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,702
She's Alicia's age.

516
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:04,237
Yeah.

517
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,243
He thinks it was Troy.

518
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:11,945
No, I don't think so.

519
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:15,115
Don't think so
or you don't want to?

520
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:17,517
Even for Troy, this is...

521
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,753
We know Walker was close.
I've seen what he's done.

522
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:23,390
Indians, right?

523
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:26,525
Took everything?
Took the helicopter?

524
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,494
- Even took your shoes?
- Yeah.

525
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:31,763
Would they leave this?

526
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:34,800
Horses? The RV?

527
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:37,135
There's a week's worth of
food and supplies in there.

528
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,781
All the things he's done...

529
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:53,551
never anything like this.

530
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,920
Not to his own people.

531
00:35:55,922 --> 00:35:57,555
Can't be absolutely sure.

532
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,259
I don't think of him as a man.

533
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,328
My boys, they go away
a couple days,

534
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,930
they come to mind.

535
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:08,633
It's like they're seven,
eight years old again.

536
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:14,438
I don't know what to do.

537
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,678
We have to go back.

538
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Now.

539
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,317
<i>Troy!</i>

540
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:19,467
<i>What happened to them?</i>

541
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,171
I'm sorry.

542
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,574
They were good people.
They didn't deserve this end.

543
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,544
Our family, we-- we weren't
prepared like you.

544
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,347
<i>We were strangers,
but you took us in.</i>

545
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,082
<i>We've come to love it here.</i>

546
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:39,087
I wish... my husband
had lived to see it.

547
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,723
But he was killed.

548
00:37:43,392 --> 00:37:45,559
Travis was killed.

549
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:50,331
He was killed by the same
people who killed Phil

550
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,100
and our people at the outpost.

551
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,842
The same people...

552
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:04,878
Walker's people...

553
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:09,783
<i>have now killed
our friends--</i>

554
00:38:09,785 --> 00:38:13,220
<i>Vernon, Kathy, Mike...</i>

555
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,723
- <i>Gretchen.</i>
- This is crazy, dude.

556
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:19,259
I've seen firsthand
how Walker treats his victims.

557
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:23,096
I saw it at the outpost,
and I just now saw it again.

558
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:25,866
<i>You built this place together.</i>

559
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,268
<i>Because of that, you've
been safe and sheltered.</i>

560
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,270
<i>You haven't been out in the world.
We have.</i>

561
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:33,939
I'm telling you,
there's nothing out there.

562
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:36,376
If you leave, you'll die.

563
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:39,646
<i>Walker's people aren't strong
enough to force us off this land.</i>

564
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:41,046
<i>They're trying to scare us.</i>

565
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:42,448
<i>That's how
they want us to go--</i>

566
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,217
a family or two at a time,

567
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:48,421
out there alone
where nobody can see,

568
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:51,090
where our militia
can't protect us.

569
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,959
<i>We cannot let ourselves
be fractured.</i>

570
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,494
There are more of us.

571
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:57,763
We're better armed.

572
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:01,133
If we stay here together,
we live.

573
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,970
<i>Yes. Yeah.</i>

574
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:44,653
That was impressive as all hell.

575
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:46,888
It was necessary.

576
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:52,560
How do you tell a lie that
big and sleep at night?

577
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:55,163
How do you do that?

578
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:56,864
What I said was true.

579
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:59,501
None of these folks
will die, not tonight,

580
00:39:59,503 --> 00:40:01,469
not tomorrow,
maybe not for a long time.

581
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:04,239
You and Alicia are safe.

582
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:06,207
I'll sleep like a baby.

583
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:10,811
Say it<i> was</i> Troy.

584
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:12,547
It was.

585
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:14,649
No one would believe us.

586
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:17,718
They're more afraid of what's out
there than anything he could do.

587
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,420
You should've told me first
before you did this.

588
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,189
You would've said no.

589
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:24,125
No. I get it.

590
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:27,762
I hate it, I get it.

591
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:30,764
I would have backed you
like I'm backing you now.

592
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:36,170
Just don't forget what he is.

593
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,952
I didn't go out there
to do that, I swear.

594
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:54,253
I...

595
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:58,424
He owed me.

596
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:04,630
He had to look me
directly in the eye.

597
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:08,100
He had to say it to my face, say it
like Vernon said it to my father.

598
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:12,871
He owed me that.

599
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,074
He didn't want
to do that, did he?

600
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,780
He said some things, and...

601
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,716
I did some things.

602
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,887
Then it went bad.

603
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:38,996
Not what you want
to hear, is it?

604
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,232
You could run this place, Troy,

605
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:44,335
but not if you let things
break like that.

606
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:47,271
Last night you had command.
I saw that.

607
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:51,609
Your militia saw that,
and they responded.

608
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:54,378
Your brother doesn't have
what you have.

609
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,780
He's not of this place.

610
00:41:56,782 --> 00:42:00,683
You're the survivor.
You're the heir.

611
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,185
So, no, the last thing
I want to hear

612
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,686
is how you lost control.

613
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,521
That can't happen.

614
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,693
I don't care how you did it.

615
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,131
I don't care why you did it.

616
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,501
All I care about
is that you can control it.

617
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:26,108
There's a fight coming,
and you have to save us.

618
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,477
Can you?

619
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,484
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:59,944
